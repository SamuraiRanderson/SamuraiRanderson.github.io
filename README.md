## Website Performance Optimization Portfolio Project
=====================================================

In this project our cohort was assigned the challenge of tackling, and correcting, some performance-related issues
that exist on a website provided to us. The main tasks were to achieve a [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) score of 90+ for index.html,
achieving 60 Frames Per Second for pizza.html, and getting the pizza size animations on pizza.html to resize in under 5 ms.

To test the optimizations implemented for pizza.html please [Click Here](http://samurairanderson.github.io./views/pizza.html)

Comments for specific changes made can be found nested within index.html, views/pizza.html, views/js/main.js, and view/css/style.css.

Below is an overview of the optimizations, modifications, and tests performed to meet the rubric specifications for this project. 
 

####Part One: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html


Measured the initial Google PageSpeed Insight scores which were - Mobile: 26/100, Desktop: 29/100.

Modifications and Optimizations Implemented
1. Removed Web Fonts.
2. Added media query to print.css.
3. Inlined style.css.
4. Resized, compressed, and locally stored the images used.
5. Inlined google-analytics.js file.
6. Async the js/analytics.js & js/perfmatters.js files.

Measured performance after making the above changes and they were - Mobile: 93/100, Desktop: 95/100.

####Part Two: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

Measured the initial Frames Per Second which was between 20 - 30 fps.

Modifications and Optimizations Implemented:
1) Added meta info to pizza.html.
2) Reduced the number of pizza's generated from 200 to 30.
3) Compressed, and resized, images.
4) Utilized style.css to assign properties to pizza images.
5) Compressed, and inlined, style.css.
6) Modified/Optimized Javascript. Changes are outlined in the comments within main.js.

Measured performance after the above changes and it is now running at 60 FPS.

####Part Three: Computation Efficiency

Measured the initial resize time which was 83.33 ms.

Modifications and Optimizations implemented to get the time to resize pizza's less than 5 ms.
1) Modified/Optimized Javascript, CSS and HTML to achieve the final result.
2) Replaced "randomPizzaContainer" (377 main.js) with "randomPizzaContainerMedium" (387 main.js) and created 
   a corresponding class for each size within 'function sizeSwitcher(size)' (434 main.js). I updated 
   pizza.html as a result of this change (109 & 126 in pizza.html). 
3) As a result of the changes made to "function sizeSwitcher(size)" I updated style.css for each size.
4) Utilized a technique by Paul Lewis (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/animations/) to rewrite
   the scroll function.
5) Removed the DOM access from the for loop in "function updatePositions()" to boost performance and avoid
   triggering a unnecessary layouts.

Measures performance after the above changes and resizing pizzas is now at 0.46 ms.
