# Move-Planner-App

This is a project for Udacity which utilizes AJAX, and API's, to create a move planner. A user can enter an
address and see the [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/views/streetview?gl=us) of the queried
address, [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) articles relating to the area, and
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) information relevant to their search.
