#####Mockup to Website

Working with graphic artists, and designers, to _accurately_ transfer their concepts and designs onto the web is essential. The first project of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program focused on that aspect of web development. I was provided with a design mockup PDF-file and had to replicate that design using HTML and CSS. The final submission of this project had to have less than an 8% margin of error.
