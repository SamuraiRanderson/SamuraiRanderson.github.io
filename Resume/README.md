# Resume
Utilizing JavaScript to create an interactive résumé.

The task was to create a online interactive résumé and to apply my knowledge of variables, objects, JSON
functions and control flow. I used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery to create a résumé which included images, 
links and incorporated Google Maps API into the final project.

This was an excellent project to showcase the power of jQuery and how to use it to manipuate the DOM.
