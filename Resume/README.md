#Interactive Résumé

This was the second project as part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. I was tasked to create a online interactive résumé and required to write clean code and to apply my knowledge of variables, objects, JSON, functions and control flow. I used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery to create a résumé which included images, links and incorporated Google Maps API into the final project.

I've come back to this project multiple times to update my résumé as I complete courses and projects, make it responsive and customize the css. I enjoyed using jQuery's DOM manipulation and incorporate different styles to append/prepend information... it's pretty powerful!
